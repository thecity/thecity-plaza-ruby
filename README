= The City Plaza Ruby Library

This Ruby library is meant to be used with The City (Software to enable communication and community in your church).

It is possible to pull church needs, topics, events, prayers and albums from the Plaza so that you can use them as necessary.

Data pulled from The City is by default cached for 1 day (24 hours) so that subsequent requests are faster.
